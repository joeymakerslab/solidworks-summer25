# SolidWorks Certification + CAD Portfolio (Summer 2025)
This repo documents my progress learning SolidWorks from scratch during Summer 2025. The goal is to earn the CSWA (Certified SolidWorks Associate) certification by August 10, 2025, the end of the summer.

I'm building my certification and CAD modeling skills alongside designing a functional rover. This portfolio tracks both the practice work and project based designs I create along the way.
